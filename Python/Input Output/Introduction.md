## 1: Taking input in Python ⭐

**Answer:**

Python provides us with two inbuilt functions to read the input from the keyboard.

input ( prompt ) <br>
raw_input ( prompt )

<br>__How the input function works in Python :__

- When input() function executes program flow will be stopped until the user has given an input.

- The text or message display on the output screen to ask a user to enter input value is optional i.e. the prompt, will be printed on the screen is optional.

- __Whatever you enter as input, input function convert it into a string. if you enter an integer value still input() function convert it into a string. You need to explicitly convert it into an integer in your code using typecasting.__

## 2: Taking multiple inputs from user in Python ? ⭐

**Answer:**

In C++/C user can take multiple inputs in one line using scanf, but in Python user can take multiple values or inputs in one line by two methods. 

- Using split() method
- Using List comprehension

<br>__Using split() method :__

This function helps in getting a multiple inputs from user. It breaks the given input by the specified separator. 

> __If a separator is not provided then any white space is a separator.__

__Syntax :__
```python
input().split(separator, maxsplit)
```
